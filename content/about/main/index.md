   I'm currently a full-time professor at Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey. I teach courses in the areas of topological data science, mathematics, and modelling. <br/><br/>I'm also a Ph.D. from the Instituto de Matemáticas de la UNAM, where I worked with Dr. José Seade. <br/><br/> My research interests area of discrete groups dynamics, geometric structures, topological data analysis and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/> Previously, I was at the Institute de Mathématics de Jussieu Paris-Rive Gauche in a Postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Elisha Falbel.<br/><br/> I have papers related to limit set of projective discrete groups, uniformization of orbifolds, representation varieties, geometric structures and computational algorithms for Hausdorff dimensions. Currently I'm interested in the detection of LLM's generated text using topological features, and Redeimaister moves using IA.<br/><br/> I have other interests as: baking, anime, gym and french music. Nice to meet you.
