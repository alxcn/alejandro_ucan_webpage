With the exploding use of LLM Neural Networks, it is common to encounter IA generated text in different scenarios: news, images, papers, etc. This propose a new ethic problem in academic scenarios: how to identify the use of LLM-generated text in student's submissions?

There are some work and software that intent to solve that problem, for example:


__examples__

Nevertheless, those softwares rely on a large data set and nowadays it is almost imposible to maintain a curated database without the presence of IA-generated text.

In __cite__, the authors provide a way to clasify fakenews using Neural networks and topology with a small data set, with a high accuracy metric.

Our project is to replicate that paper in an academic scenario with curated and small databases, and implement those Neural Networks in an adaptable software.

This project started in December July 2024, as a proposition of Bs. Azahel Ramirez, and have been actively studied in collaboration of:

1. Luis
2. Daniel

We have our first results with a 0.9 accuracy using a answer-response database. We are working actively on the paper with the proper results.
