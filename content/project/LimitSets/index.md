Complex kleinian groups took an interesting role in the last twenty years, principally due to its relation with complex dynamics, geometry and topology. As an example, here is the book Cano, Navarrete and Seade (2013).

A _complex kleinian group_ is a discrete subgroup of \\(PSL(n+1,\mathbb{C})\\) acting on the n-dimensional complex projective space with a non-empty region where the group acts properly discontinuously. 

For example, if we take the diagonal matrix \\(D=(2,1,1/2),\\) the group containing all the powers of \\(D\\) is a complex kleinian group in \\(PSL(3,\mathbb{C}).\\)

The complex kleinian subgroups in \\(PSL(3,\mathbb{C})\\) are the most studied examples of complex kleinian groups. But for higher dimension there several characteristic that are still open questions.

For example, the limit set for complex kleinian groups in \\(PSL(n+1,\mathbb{C})\\) is an open question. This is mainly because there are several definitions that are valid, with no aparent relation. Those definitions depend on the desired characteristic to explore and could be: dynamical, proximality or holomorphic.

The intention of this project is to understand the relation between the different notions of limit sets for a family of discrete subgroups in \\(PSL(n+1,\mathbb{C})\\).

This is a joint work with Dr. Jose Seade and Dr. Angel Cano of the Unidad Cuernavaca del Instituto de Matem√°ticas, UNAM.
