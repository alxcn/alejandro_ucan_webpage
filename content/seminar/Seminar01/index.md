# Abstract

This talk introduces a new method that improves segmentation in neural networks by focusing on learning rather than changing the model architecture. Using mutual information as a learning goal, an auxiliary network enhances the information shared between input and output, refining weight adjustments. This improves the model's ability to capture relationships, leading to better performance across various tasks. Extensive tests show improved accuracy for both large and small objects. The method results in more adaptive, nonlinear contours, enhancing object separation and cohesion without needing architectural changes.
