__Abstract:__ We classify representations of a class of Deligne-Mostow lattices into PGL⁡(3,ℂ). In particular, we show local rigidity for the representations (of Deligne-Mostow lattices with three-fold symmetry and of type one) where the generators we chose are of the same type as the generators of Deligne-Mostow lattices. We also show local rigidity without constraints on the type of generators for six of them and we show the existence of local deformations for a number of representations in three of them. We use formal computations in SAGE and Maple to obtain the results. The code files are available on GitHub ([Citation7]).

## 2022

__Abstract:__ In the present work, we study the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of Schottky groups on the boundary of the complex hyperbolic group via the Eigenvalue algorithm as in [17]. The visual geometry on $\overline{\mathbb{H}^2_\mathbb{C}}$
 allows a direct application of the Eigenvalue algorithm, but at the same time, it hardens the computations. Using the Heisenberg structure on $\partial \mathbb{H}^2_\mathbb{C}\setminus\infty$ 
 and the Cygan metric, we propose a Markov partition associated with the group that simplifies the application of the Eigenvalue algorithm.

__Abstrac:__ In this article we show that Bers’ simultaneous uniformization and Köebe’s retrosection theorem do not hold for discrete groups of projective transformations acting on complex projective space.

__Abstract:__ In this article we provide a classification of the projective transformations in $PSL(n+1,\mathbb{C})$
 considered as automorphisms of the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_\mathbb{C}$. Our classification is an interplay between algebra and dynamics. Just as in the case of isometries of $CAT(0)$
-spaces, this is given by means of three types of transformations, namely: elliptic, parabolic and loxodromic. We describe the dynamics in each case, more precisely we determine the corresponding Kulkarni's limit set, the equicontinuity region, minimal sets, the discontinuity region and maximal regions where the corresponding cyclic group acts properly discontinuously. We also provide, in each case, some equivalent ways to classify the projective transformations.

__Abstract:__ In the following, we will describe the equicontinuous set of a family of discrete subgroups of $PSL(n+1, \mathbb{C})$ in aims to obtain a family of examples of complex Kleinian groups.
